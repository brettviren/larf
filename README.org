#+TITLE: LArTPC Field Calculation Using BEM

* Overview

*Note: this package is still a work in progress!*

*Note: this documentation is still a mish mash and may not represent reality!*

This package:

- models simple parametric 3D geometric objects such as needed to describe electrodes in a LArTPC.
- generates a 2D mesh on a scene composed of one or more 3D objects.
- allows defining surface potentials on the domain of these objects.
- uses [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_element_method][Boundary Element Method]] to solve the integral of the Laplace equation on this domain.
- evaluates the solution at points in the volume.
- interprets solutions as 3D electrostatic potential producing an Electric drift field.
- interprets solutions as 3D Shockley-Ramo weighting potentials and associated drift field.
- steps through the drift field using adaptive Runge-Kutta evaluating the weighting potential and collecting instantaneous currents induced on the electrodes.
- provides data provenance, bookkeeping, conversion and visualization for these above steps.
