** Gaussian quadrature

BEM++ [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_quadrature][Gaussian quadrature]] rule to do the boundary integrals.  The
precision of this is governed by how many points on any pair of
triangles are evaluated.  The [[http://www.bempp.org/quadrature.html][table in the BEM++ docs]] gives default
values and how to change them.  Of particular note is that the number
of evaluations can be set at three length scales

The effect of having the number of evaluations too low can be seen by
looking at the solved potential near by a boundary.  It manifests as
square boundaries of different sizes where the solution has small but
clear discontinuities.

To show this problem, a simple capacitor geometry is made:

[[./capacitor-mini-special.png]]

It has +/- 5000V applied.  Using the nominal number of evaluations
gives the potential:

Quadrupling the near, medium and far orders gives a potential:

Some discontinuities can still be seen but they are clearly reduced.
The mesh has 4240 elements and 2124 vertices.  
The calculation time increased by factor of approximately 5.
